Dino Story

Chapter 1
---------
A long long time ago, a ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex named Tyler lived
next to a river in a swampy, smelly jungle. According to his neighbor
Terry the Pterodactyl, Tyler was the meanest dinosaur in the whole
jungle. Tyler spent most of his time stomping through the dense
undergrowth, roaring at smaller dinos that got in his way.
